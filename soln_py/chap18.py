# # Python Extras
#
# One of my goals for this book has been to teach you as little Python as possible. 
# When there were two ways to do something, I picked one and avoided mentioning the other.
# Or sometimes I put the second one into an exercise.
#
# Now I want to go back for some of the good bits that got left behind.
# Python provides a number of features that are not really necessary -- you can write good code without them -- but with them you can write code that's more concise, readable, or efficient, and sometimes all three.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sets
#
# Python provides a class called `set` that represents a collection of unique elements.
# To create an empty set, we can use the class object like a function.

# %%
s1 = set()
s1

# %% [markdown]
# We can use the `add` method to add elements.

# %%
s1.add('a')
s1.add('b')
s1

# %% [markdown]
# Or we can pass any kind of sequence to `set`.

# %%
s2 = set('acd')
s2

# %% [markdown]
# An element can only appear once in a `set`.
# If you add an element that's already there, it has no effect.

# %%
s1.add('a')
s1

# %% [markdown]
# Or if you create a set with a sequence that contains duplicates, the result contains only unique elements.

# %%
set('banana')


# %% [markdown]
# Some of the exercises in this book can be done concisely and efficiently with sets. 
# For example, here is a solution to an exercise in Chapter 11 that uses a dictionary to check whether there are any duplicate elements in a sequence.

# %%
def has_duplicates(t):
    d = {}
    for x in t:
        d[x] = True
    return len(d) < len(t)


# %% [markdown]
# This version adds the element of `t` as keys in a dictionary, and then checks whether there are fewer keys than elements.
# Using sets, we can write the same function like this.

# %%
def has_duplicates(t):
    s = set(t)
    return len(s) < len(t)


# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
has_duplicates('abba')

# %% [markdown]
# An element can only appear in a set once, so if an element in `t` appears more than once, the set will be smaller than `t`.
# If there are no duplicates, the set will be the same size as `t`.
#
# `set` objects provide methods that perform set operations.
# For example, `union` computes the union of two sets, which is a new set that contains all elements that appear in either set.

# %%
s1.union(s2)

# %% [markdown]
# Some arithmetic operators work with sets.
# For example, the `-` operator performs set subtraction -- the result is a new set that contains all elements from the first set that are _not_ in the second set.

# %%
s1 - s2


# %% [markdown]
# In [Chapter 12](section_dictionary_subtraction) we used dictionaries to find the words that appear in a document but not in a word list.
# We used the following function, which takes two dictionaries and returns a new dictionary that contains only the keys from the first that don't appear in the second.

# %%
def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = d1[key]
    return res


# %% [markdown]
# With sets, we don't have to write this function ourselves.
# If `word_counter` is a dictionary that contains the unique words in the document and `word_list` is a list of valid words, we can compute the set difference like this.

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
# this cell creates a small example so we can run the following
# cell without loading the actual data

word_counter = {'word': 1}
word_list = ['word']

# %% tags=["remove-output"]
set(word_counter) - set(word_list)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is a set that contains the words in the document that don't appear in the word list.
#
# The relational operators work with sets.
# For example, `<=` checks whether one set is a subset of another, including the possibility that they are equal.

# %%
set('ab') <= set('abc')


# %% [markdown]
# With these operators, we can use sets to do some of the exercises in ChapterÂ 7.
# For example, here's a version of `uses_only` that uses a loop.

# %%
def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True


# %% [markdown]
# `uses_only` checks whether all letters in `word` are in `available`.
# With sets, we can rewrite it like this.

# %%
def uses_only(word, available):
    return set(word) <= set(available)


# %% [markdown]
# If the letters in `word` are a subset of the letters in `available`, that means that `word` uses only letters in `available`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Counters
#
# A `Counter` is like a set, except that if an element appears more than once, the `Counter` keeps track of how many times it appears.
# If you are familiar with the mathematical idea of a "multiset", a `Counter` is a
# natural way to represent a multiset.
#
# The `Counter` class is defined in a module called `collections`, so you have to import it.
# Then you can use the class object as a function and pass as an argument a string, list, or any other kind of sequence.

# %%
from collections import Counter

counter = Counter('banana')
counter

# %%
from collections import Counter

t = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3)
counter = Counter(t)
counter

# %% [markdown]
# A `Counter` object is like a dictionary that maps from each key to the number of times it appears.
# As in dictionaries, the keys have to be hashable.
#
# Unlike dictionaries, `Counter` objects don't raise an exception if you access an
# element that doesn't appear.
# Instead, they return `0`.

# %%
counter['d']


# %% [markdown]
# We can use `Counter` objects to solve one of the exercises from Chapter 10, which asks for a function that takes two words and checks whether they are anagrams -- that is, whether the letters from one can be rearranged to spell the other.
#
# Here's a solution using `Counter` objects.

# %%
def is_anagram(word1, word2):
    return Counter(word1) == Counter(word2)


# %% [markdown]
# If two words are anagrams, they contain the same letters with the same counts, so their `Counter` objects are equivalent.
#
# `Counter` provides a method called `most_common` that returns a list of value-frequency pairs, sorted from most common to least.

# %%
counter.most_common()

# %% [markdown]
# They also provide methods and operators to perform set-like operations, including addition, subtraction, union and intersection.
# For example, the `+` operator combines two `Counter` objects and creates a new `Counter` that contains the keys from both and the sums of the counts.
#
# We can test it by making a `Counter` with the letters from `'bans'` and adding it to the letters from `'banana'`.

# %%
counter2 = Counter('bans')
counter + counter2

# %% [markdown]
# You'll have a chance to explore other `Counter` operations in the exercises at the end of this chapter.

# %% [markdown]
# ## defaultdict
#
# The `collections` module also provides `defaultdict`, which is like a dictionary except that if you access a key that doesn't exist, it generates a new value automatically.
#
# When you create a `defaultdict`, you provide a function that's used to create new values.
# A function that create objects is sometimes called a **factory**.
# The built-in functions that create lists, sets, and other types can be used as factories.
#
# For example, here's a `defaultdict` that creates a new `list` when needed. 

# %%
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
d

# %% [markdown]
# Notice that the argument is `list`, which is a class object, not `list()`, which is a function call that creates a new list.
# The factory function doesn't get called unless we access a key that doesn't exist.

# %%
t = d['new key']
t

# %% [markdown]
# The new list, which we're calling `t`, is also added to the dictionary.
# So if we modify `t`, the change appears in `d`:

# %%
t.append('new value')
d['new key']


# %% [markdown]
# If you are making a dictionary of lists, you can often write simpler
# code using `defaultdict`. 
#
# In one of the exercises in [Chapter 11](chapter_tuples), I made a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of words that can be spelled with those letters.
# For example, the string `'opst'` maps to the list `['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', 'tops']`.
# Here's the original code.

# %%
def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = {}
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        if t not in d:
            d[t] = [word]
        else:
            d[t].append(word)
    return d


# %% [markdown]
# And here's a simpler version using a `defaultdict`.

# %%
def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        d[t].append(word)
    return d


# %% [markdown]
# In the exercises at the end of the chapter, you'll have a chance to practice using `defaultdict` objects.

# %%
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
key = ('into', 'the')
d[key].append('woods')
d[key]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conditional expressions
#
# Conditional statements are often used to choose one of two values, like this:

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
import math
x = 5

# %%
if x > 0:
    y = math.log(x)
else:
    y = float('nan')

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
y

# %% [markdown]
# This statement checks whether `x` is positive. If so, it computes its logarithm. 
# If not, `math.log` would raise a ValueError.
# To avoid stopping the program, we generate a `NaN`, which is a special floating-point value that represents "Not a Number".
#
# We can write this statement more concisely using a **conditional expression**.

# %%
y = math.log(x) if x > 0 else float('nan')

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
y


# %% [markdown]
# You can almost read this line like English: "`y` gets log-`x` if `x` is greater than 0; otherwise it gets `NaN`".
#
# Recursive functions can sometimes be written concisely using conditional expressions. 
# For example, here is a version of `factorial` with a conditional _statement_.

# %%
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)


# %% [markdown]
# And here's a version with a conditional _expression_.

# %%
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)


# %% [markdown]
# Another use of conditional expressions is handling optional arguments.
# For example, here is class definition with an `__init__` method that uses a conditional statement to check a parameter with a default value.

# %%
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        self.name = name
        if contents is None:
            contents = []
        self.contents = contents


# %% [markdown]
# Here's a version that uses a conditional expression.

# %%
def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
    self.name = name
    self.contents = [] if contents is None else contents 


# %% [markdown]
# In general, you can replace a conditional statement with a conditional expression if both branches contain a single expression and no statements.

# %% [markdown]
# ## List comprehensions
#
# In previous chapters, we've seen a few examples where we start with an empty list and add elements, one at a time, using the `append` method.
# For example, suppose we have a string that contains the title of a movie, and we want to capitalize all of the words.

# %%
title = 'monty python and the holy grail'

# %% [markdown]
# We can split it into a list of strings, loop through the strings, capitalize them, and append them to a list.

# %%
t = []
for word in title.split():
    t.append(word.capitalize())

' '.join(t)

# %% [markdown]
# We can do the same thing more concisely using a **list comprehension**:

# %%
t = [word.capitalize() for word in title.split()]

' '.join(t)

# %% [markdown]
# The bracket operators indicate that we are constructing a new list.
# The expression inside the brackets specifies the elements of the list, and the `for` clause indicates what sequence we are looping through.
#
# The syntax of a list comprehension might seem strange, because the loop variable -- `word` in this example -- appears in the expression before we get to its definition.
# But you get used to it.
#
# As another example, in [Chapter 9](section_word_list) we used this loop to read words from a file and append them to a list.

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
download('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2/master/code/words.txt');

# %%
word_list = []

for line in open('words.txt'):
    word = line.strip()
    word_list.append(word)

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
len(word_list)

# %% [markdown]
# Here's how we can write that as a list comprehension.

# %%
word_list = [line.strip() for line in open('words.txt')]

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
len(word_list)


# %% [markdown]
# A list comprehension can also have an `if` clause that determines which elements are included in the list.
# For example, here's a `for` loop we used in [Chapter 10](section_palindrome_list) to make a list of only the words in `word_list` that are palindromes.

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
def is_palindrome(word):
    return list(reversed(word)) == list(word)


# %%
palindromes = []

for word in word_list:
    if is_palindrome(word):
        palindromes.append(word)

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
palindromes[:10]

# %% [markdown]
# Here's how we can do the same thing with an list comprehension.

# %%
palindromes = [word for word in word_list if is_palindrome(word)]

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
palindromes[:10]

# %% [markdown]
# When a list comprehension is used as an argument to a function, we can often omit the brackets.
# For example, suppose we want to add up $1 / 2^n$ for values of $n$ from 0 to 9.
# We can use a list comprehension like this.

# %%
sum([1/2**n for n in range(10)])

# %% [markdown]
# Or we can leave out the brackets like this.

# %%
sum(1/2**n for n in range(10))

# %% [markdown]
# In this example, the argument is technically a **generator expression**, not a list comprehension, and it never actually makes a list.
# But other than that, the behavior is the same.
#
# List comprehensions and generator expressions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions.
# And they are usually faster than the equivalent for loops, sometimes much faster.
# So if you are mad at me for not mentioning them earlier, I understand.
#
# But, in my defense, list comprehensions are harder to debug because you can't put a print statement inside the loop.
# I suggest you use them only if the computation is simple enough that you are likely to get it
# right the first time.
# Or consider writing and debugging a `for` loop and then converting it to a list comprehension.

# %% [markdown]
# ## `any` and `all`
#
# Python provides a built-in function, `any`, that takes a sequence of boolean values and returns `True` if any of the values are `True`.

# %%
any([False, False, True])

# %% [markdown]
# `any` is often used with generator expressions.

# %%
any(letter == 't' for letter in 'monty')


# %% [markdown]
# That example isn't very useful because it does the same thing as the `in` operator. 
# But we could use `any` to write concise solutions to some of the exercises in [Chapter 7](chapter_search). For example, we can write `uses_none` like this.

# %%
def uses_none(word, forbidden):
    """Checks whether a word avoids forbidden letters."""
    return not any(letter in forbidden for letter in word)


# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
uses_none('banana', 'xyz')

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
uses_none('apple', 'efg')


# %% [markdown]
# This function loops through the letters in `word` and checks whether any of them are in `forbidden`.
# Using `any` with a generator expression is efficient because it stops immediately if it finds a `True` value, so it doesn't have to loop through the whole sequence.
#
# Python provides another built-in function, `all`, that returns `True` if every element of the sequence is `True`.
# We can use it to write a concise version of `uses_all`.

# %%
def uses_all(word, required):
    """Check whether a word uses all required letters."""
    return all(letter in word for letter in required)


# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
uses_all('banana', 'ban')

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
uses_all('apple', 'api')


# %% [markdown]
# Expressions using `any` and `all` can be concise, efficient, and easy to read.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Named tuples
#
# The `collections` module provides a function called `namedtuple` that can be used to create simple classes.
# For example, the `Point` object in [Chapter 16](section_create_point) has only two attributes, `x` and `y`.
# Here's how we defined it.

# %%
class Point:
    """Represents a point in 2-D space."""
    
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f'({self.x}, {self.y})'


# %% [markdown]
# That's a lot of code to convey a small amount of information.
# `namedtuple` provides a more concise way to define classes like this.

# %%
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])

# %% [markdown]
# The first argument is the name of the class you want to create. The
# second is a list of the attributes `Point` objects should have.
# The result is a class object, which is why it is assigned to a capitalized variable name.
#
# A class created with `namedtuple` provides an `__init__` method that assigns values to the attributes and a `__str__` that displays the object in a readable form.
# So we can create and display a `Point` object like this.

# %%
p = Point(1, 2)
p

# %% [markdown]
# `Point` also provides an `__eq__` method that checks whether two `Point` objects are equivalent -- that is, whether their attributes are the same.

# %%
p == Point(1, 2)

# %% [markdown]
# You can access the elements of a named tuple by name or by index.

# %%
p.x, p.y

# %%
p[0], p[1]

# %% [markdown]
# You can also treat a named tuple as a tuple, as in this assignment.

# %%
x, y = p
x, y

# %% [markdown]
# But `namedtuple` objects are immutable.
# After the attributes are initialized, they can't be changed.

# %% tags=["raises-exception"]
# %%expect TypeError

p[0] = 3

# %% tags=["raises-exception"]
# %%expect AttributeError

p.x = 3


# %% [markdown]
# `namedtuple` provides a quick way to define simple classes.
# The drawback is that simple classes don't always stay simple.
# You might decide later that you want to add methods to a named tuple.
# In that case, you can define a new class that inherits from the named tuple.

# %%
class Pointier(Point):
    """This class inherits from Point"""


# %% [markdown]
# Or at that point you could switch to a conventional class definition.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Packing keyword arguments
#
# In [Chapter 11](section_argument_pack), we wrote a function that packs its arguments into a tuple.

# %%
def mean(*args):
    return sum(args) / len(args)


# %% [markdown]
# You can call this function with any number of arguments.

# %%
mean(1, 2, 3)

# %% [markdown]
# But the `*` operator doesn't pack keyword arguments.
# So calling this function with a keyword argument causes an error.

# %% tags=["raises-exception"]
# %%expect TypeError

mean(1, 2, start=3)


# %% [markdown]
# To pack keyword arguments, we can use the `**` operator:

# %%
def mean(*args, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    return sum(args) / len(args)


# %% [markdown]
# The keyword-packing parameter can have any name, but `kwargs` is a common choice.
# The result is a dictionary that maps from keywords to values.

# %%
mean(1, 2, start=3)


# %% [markdown]
# In this example, the value of `kwargs` is printed, but otherwise is has no effect.
#
# But the `**` operator can also be used in an argument list to unpack a dictionary.
# For example, here's a version of `mean` that packs any keyword arguments it gets and then unpacks them as keyword arguments for `sum`.

# %%
def mean(*args, **kwargs):
    return sum(args, **kwargs) / len(args)


# %% [markdown]
# Now if we call `mean` with `start` as a keyword argument, it gets passed along to sum, which uses it as the starting point of the summation.
# In the following example `start=3` adds `3` to the sum before computing the mean, so the sum is `6` and the result is `3`.

# %%
mean(1, 2, start=3)

# %% [markdown]
# As another example, if we have a dictionary with keys `x` and `y`, we can use it with the unpack operator to create a `Point` object.

# %%
d = dict(x=1, y=2)
Point(**d)

# %% [markdown]
# Without the unpack operator, `d` is treated as a single positional argument, so it gets assigned to `x`, and we get a `TypeError` because there's no second argument to assign to `y`.

# %% tags=["raises-exception"]
# %%expect TypeError

d = dict(x=1, y=2)
Point(d)


# %% [markdown]
# When you are working with functions that have a large number of keyword arguments, it is often useful to create and pass around dictionaries that specify frequently used options.

# %%
def pack_and_print(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    
pack_and_print(a=1, b=2)


# %% [markdown]
# ## Debugging
#
# In previous chapters, we used `doctest` to test functions.
# For example, here's a function called `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
# In includes a doctest that checks whether `2 + 2` is `4`.

# %%
def add(a, b):
    '''Add two numbers.
    
    >>> add(2, 2)
    4
    '''
    return a + b


# %% [markdown]
# This function takes a function object and runs its doctests.

# %%
from doctest import run_docstring_examples

def run_doctests(func):
    run_docstring_examples(func, globals(), name=func.__name__)


# %% [markdown]
# So we can test `add` like this.

# There's no output, which means all tests passed.
#
# Python provides another tool for running automated tests, called `unittest`.
# It is a little more complicated to use, but here's an example.

# %%
from unittest import TestCase

class TestExample(TestCase):

    def test_add(self):
        result = add(2, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 4)


# %% [markdown]
# First we import `TestCase`, which is a class in the `unittest` module.
# To use it, we have to define a new class that inherits from `TestCase` and provides at least one test method.
# The name of the test method must begin with `test` and should indicate which function it tests.
#
# In this example, `test_add` tests the `add` function by calling it, saving the result, and invoking `assertEqual`, which is inherited from `TestCase`.
# `assertEqual` takes two arguments and checks whether they are equal.
#
# In order to run this test method, we have to run a function in `unittest` called `main` and provide several keyword arguments.
# The following function shows the details -- if you are curious, you can ask a virtual assistant to explain how it works.

# %%
import unittest

def run_unittest():
    unittest.main(argv=[''], verbosity=0, exit=False)


# %% [markdown]
# `run_unittest` does not take `TestExample` as an argument -- instead, it searches for classes that inherit from `TestCase`.
# Then it searches for methods that begin with `test` and runs them.
# This process is called **test discovery**.
#
# Here's what happens when we call `run_unittest`.

# %%
run_unittest()

# %% [markdown]
# `unittest.main` reports the number of tests it ran and the results.
# In this case `OK` indicates that the tests passed.
#
# To see what happens when a test fails, we'll add an incorrect test method to `TestExample`.

# %%
# %%add_method_to TestExample

    def test_add_broken(self):
        result = add(2, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 100)

# %% [markdown]
# Here's what happens when we run the tests.

# %%
run_unittest()


# %% [markdown]
# The report includes the test method that failed and an error message showing where.
# The summary indicates that two tests ran and one failed.
#
# In the exercises below, I'll suggest some prompts you can use to ask a virtual assistant for more information about `unittest`.

# ## Glossary
#
# **factory:**
#  A function used to create objects, often passed as a parameter to a function.
#
# **conditional expression:**
# An expression that uses a conditional to select one of two values.
#
# **list comprehension:**
# A concise way to loop through a sequence and create a list.
#
# **generator expression:**
# Similar to a list comprehension except that it does not create a list.

# ### Ask a virtual assistant
#
# There are a few topics in this chapter you might want to learn about.
#
# * "What are the methods and operators of Python's set class?"
#
# * "What are the methods and operators of Python's Counter class?"
#
# * "What is the difference between a Python list comprehension and a generator expression?"
#
# * "When should I use Python's `namedtuple` rather than define a new class?"
#
# * "What are some uses of packing and unpacking keyword arguments?"
#
# * "How does `unittest` do test discovery?"
#
# * "Along with `assertEqual`, what are the most commonly used methods in `unittest.TestCase`?"
#
# * "What are the pros and cons of `doctest` and `unittest`?"
#
# For the following exercises, consider asking a virtual assistant for help, but as always, remember to test the results.

# ### Exercise
#
# One of the exercises in Chapter 7 asks for a function called `uses_none` that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and returns `True` if the word does not use any of the letters. Here's a solution.

# %%
def uses_none(word, forbidden):
    for letter in word.lower():
        if letter in forbidden.lower():
            return False

# Write a version of this function that uses `set` operations instead of a `for` loop.
# Hint: ask a VA, "How do I compute the intersection of Python sets?"

# ### Exercise
#
# Scrabble is a board game where the objective is to use letter tiles to spell words.
# For example, if we have tiles with the letters `T`, `A`, `B`, `L`, `E`, we can spell `BELT` and `LATE` using a subset of the tiles -- but we can't spell `BEET` because we don't have two `E`s.

# Write a function that takes a string of letters and a word, and checks whether the letters can spell the word, taking into account how many times each letter appears.
