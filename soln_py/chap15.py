# # Classes and Methods
#
# Python is an **object-oriented language** -- that is, it provides features that support object-oriented programming, which has these defining characteristics:
#
# -   Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.
#
# -   Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to the ways things in the real world interact.
#
# -   Programs include class and method definitions.
#
# For example, in the previous chapter we defined a `Time` class that corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and we defined functions that correspond to the kinds of things people do with times.
# But there was no explicit connection between the definition of the `Time` class and the function definitions that follow.
# We can make the connection explicit by rewriting a function as a **method**, which is defined inside a class definition.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Defining methods
#
# In the previous chapter we defined a class named `Time` and wrote a function named `print_time` that displays a time of day.

# %%
class Time:
    """Represents the time of day."""

def print_time(time):
    s = f'{time.hour:02d}:{time.minute:02d}:{time.second:02d}'
    print(s)


# %% [markdown]
# To make `print_time` a method, all we have to do is move the function
# definition inside the class definition. Notice the change in
# indentation.
#
# At the same time, we'll change the name of the parameter from `time` to `self`.
# This change is not necessary, but it is conventional for the first parameter of a method to be named `self`.

# %%
class Time:
    """Represents the time of day."""    

    def print_time(self):
        s = f'{self.hour:02d}:{self.minute:02d}:{self.second:02d}'
        print(s)


# %% [markdown]
# To call this method, you have to pass a `Time` object as an argument.
# Here's the function we'll use to make a `Time` object.

# %%
def make_time(hour, minute, second):
    time = Time()
    time.hour = hour
    time.minute = minute
    time.second = second
    return time


# %% [markdown]
# And here's a `Time` instance.

# %%
start = make_time(9, 40, 0)

# %% [markdown]
# Now there are two ways to call `print_time`. The first (and less common)
# way is to use function syntax.

# %%
Time.print_time(start)

# %% [markdown]
# In this version, `Time` is the name of the class, `print_time` is the name of the method, and `start` is passed as a parameter.
# The second (and more idiomatic) way is to use method syntax:

# %%
start.print_time()


# %% [markdown]
# In this version, `start` is the object the method is invoked on, which is called the **receiver**, based on the analogy that invoking a method is like sending a message to an object.
#
# Regardless of the syntax, the behavior of the method is the same.
# The receiver is assigned to the first parameter, so inside the method, `self` refers to the same object as `start`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Another method
#
# Here's the `time_to_int` function from the previous chapter.

# %%
def time_to_int(time):
    minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute
    seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second
    return seconds


# %% [markdown]
# And here's a version rewritten as a method.
#

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def time_to_int(self):
        minutes = self.hour * 60 + self.minute
        seconds = minutes * 60 + self.second
        return seconds

# %% [markdown]
# The first line uses the special command `add_method_to`, which adds a method to a previously-defined class.
# This command works in a Jupyter notebook, but it is not part of Python, so it won't work in other environments.
# Normally, all methods of a class are inside the class definition, so they get defined at the same time as the class.
# But for this book, it is helpful to define one method at a time.
#
# As in the previous example, the method definition is indented and the name of the parameter is `self`.
# Other than that, the method is identical to the function.
# Here's how we invoke it.

# %%
start.time_to_int()


# %% [markdown]
# It is common to say that we "call" a function and "invoke" a method, but they mean the same thing.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Static methods
#
# As another example, let's consider the `int_to_time` function.
# Here's the version from the previous chapter.

# %%
def int_to_time(seconds):
    minute, second = divmod(seconds, 60)
    hour, minute = divmod(minute, 60)
    return make_time(hour, minute, second)


# %% [markdown]
# This function takes `seconds` as a parameter and returns a new `Time` object.
# If we transform it into a method of the `Time` class, we have to invoke it on a `Time` object.
# But if we're trying to create a new `Time` object, what are we supposed to invoke it on?
#
# We can solve this chicken-and-egg problem using a **static method**, which is a method that does not require an instance of the class to be invoked.
# Here's how we rewrite this function as a static method.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def int_to_time(seconds):
        minute, second = divmod(seconds, 60)
        hour, minute = divmod(minute, 60)
        return make_time(hour, minute, second)

# %% [markdown]
# Because it is a static method, it does not have `self` as a parameter.
# To invoke it, we use `Time`, which is the class object.

# %%
start = Time.int_to_time(34800)

# %% [markdown]
# The result is a new object that represents 9:40.

# %%
start.print_time()


# %% [markdown]
# Now that we have `Time.from_seconds`, we can use it to write `add_time` as a method.
# Here's the function from the previous chapter.

# %%
def add_time(time, hours, minutes, seconds):
    duration = make_time(hours, minutes, seconds)
    seconds = time_to_int(time) + time_to_int(duration)
    return int_to_time(seconds)


# %% [markdown]
# And here's a version rewritten as a method.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def add_time(self, hours, minutes, seconds):
        duration = make_time(hours, minutes, seconds)
        seconds = time_to_int(self) + time_to_int(duration)
        return Time.int_to_time(seconds)

# %% [markdown]
# `add_time` has `self` as a parameter because it is not a static method.
# It is an ordinary method -- also called an **instance method**.
# To invoke it, we need a `Time` instance.

# %%
end = start.add_time(1, 32, 0)
print_time(end)


# %% [markdown]
# ## Comparing Time objects
#
# As one more example, let's write `is_after` as a method.
# Here's the `is_after` function, which is a solution to an exercise in the previous chapter.

# %%
def is_after(t1, t2):
    return time_to_int(t1) > time_to_int(t2)


# %% [markdown]
# And here it is as a method.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def is_after(self, other):
        return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int()

# %% [markdown]
# Because we're comparing two objects, and the first parameter is `self`, we'll call the second parameter `other`.
# To use this method, we have to invoke it on one object and pass the
# other as an argument.

# %%
end.is_after(start)

# %% [markdown]
# One nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads like a question,
# "`end` is after `start`?"

# %% [markdown]
# ## The `__str__` method
#
# When you write a method, you can choose almost any name you want.
# However, some names have special meanings.
# For example, if an object has a method named `__str__`, Python uses that method to convert the object to a string.
# For example, here is a `__str__` method for a time object.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def __str__(self):
        s = f'{self.hour:02d}:{self.minute:02d}:{self.second:02d}'
        return s

# %% [markdown]
# This method is similar to `print_time`, from the previous chapter, except that it returns the string rather than printing it.
#
# You can invoke this method in the usual way.

# %%
end.__str__()

# %% [markdown]
# But Python can also invoke it for you.
# If you use the built-in function `str` to convert a `Time` object to a string, Python uses the `__str__` method in the `Time` class.

# %%
str(end)

# %% [markdown]
# And it does the same if you print a `Time` object.

# %%
print(end)

# %% [markdown]
# Methods like `__str__` are called **special methods**.
# You can identify them because their names begin and end with two underscores.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The __init__ method
#
# The most special of the special methods is `__init__`, so-called because it initializes the attributes of a new object.
# An `__init__` method for the `Time` class might look like this:

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second

# %% [markdown]
# Now when we instantiate a `Time` object, Python invokes `__init__`, and passes along the arguments.
# So we can create an object and initialize the attributes at the same time.

# %%
time = Time(9, 40, 0)
print(time)

# %% [markdown]
# In this example, the parameters are optional, so if you call `Time` with no arguments,
# you get the default values.

# %%
time = Time()
print(time)

# %% [markdown]
# If you provide one argument, it overrides `hour`:

# %%
time = Time(9)
print(time)

# %% [markdown]
# If you provide two arguments, they override `hour` and `minute`.

# %%
time = Time(9, 45)
print(time)

# %% [markdown]
# And if you provide three arguments, they override all three default
# values.
#
# When I write a new class, I almost always start by writing `__init__`, which makes it easier to create objects, and `__str__`, which is useful for debugging.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Operator overloading
#
# By defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior of
# operators on programmer-defined types. For example, if you define a
# method named `__add__` for the `Time` class, you can use the `+`
# operator on Time objects.
#
# Here is an `__add__` method.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def __add__(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return Time.int_to_time(seconds)

# %% [markdown]
# We can use it like this.

# %%
duration = Time(1, 32)
end = start + duration
print(end)

# %% [markdown]
# There is a lot happening when we run these three lines of code:
#
# * When we instantiate a `Time` object, the `__init__` method is invoked.
#
# * When we use the `+` operator with a `Time` object, its `__add__` method is invoked.
#
# * And when we print a `Time` object, its `__str__` method is invoked.
#
# Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with programmer-defined types is called **operator overloading**.
# For every operator, like `+`, there is a corresponding special method, like `__add__`. 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Debugging
#
# A `Time` object is valid if the values of `minute` and `second` are between `0` and `60` -- including `0` but not `60` -- and if `hour` is positive.
# Also, `hour` and `minute` should be integer values, but we might allow `second` to have a fraction part.
# Requirements like these are called **invariants** because they should always be true.
# To put it a different way, if they are not true, something has gone wrong.
#
# Writing code to check invariants can help detect errors and find their causes.
# For example, you might have a method like `is_valid` that takes a Time object and returns `False` if it violates an invariant.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def is_valid(self):
        if self.hour < 0 or self.minute < 0 or self.second < 0:
            return False
        if self.minute >= 60 or self.second >= 60:
            return False
        if not isinstance(self.hour, int):
            return False
        if not isinstance(self.minute, int):
            return False
        return True

# %% [markdown]
# Then, at the beginning of each method you can check the arguments to make sure they are valid.

# %%
# %%add_method_to Time

    def is_after(self, other):
        assert self.is_valid(), 'self is not a valid Time'
        assert other.is_valid(), 'self is not a valid Time'
        return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int()

# %% [markdown]
# The `assert` statement evaluates the expression that follows. If the result is `True`, it does nothing; if the result is `False`, it causes an `AssertionError`.
# Here's an example.

# %%
duration = Time(minute=132)
print(duration)

# %% tags=["raises-exception"]
# %%expect AssertionError

start.is_after(duration)


# %% [markdown]
# `assert` statements are useful because they distinguish code that deals with normal conditions from code that checks for errors.

# ### Ask a virtual assistant
#
# For more information about static methods, ask a virtual assistant:
#
# * "What's the difference between an instance method and a static method?"
#
# * "Why are static methods called static?"
#
# If you ask a virtual assistant to generate a static method, the result will probably begin with `@staticmethod`, which is a "decorator" that indicates that it is a static method.
# Decorators are not covered in this book, but if you are curious, you can ask a VA for more information.
#
# In this chapter we rewrote several functions as methods.
# Virtual assistants are generally good at this kind of code transformation.
# As an example, paste the following function into a VA and ask it, "Rewrite this function as a method of the `Time` class."

# %%
def subtract_time(t1, t2):
    return time_to_int(t1) - time_to_int(t2)


# %% [markdown]
# ### Exercise
#
# In the previous chapter, a series of exercises asked you to write a `Date` class and several functions that work with `Date` objects.
# Now let's practice rewriting those functions as methods.
#
# 1. Write a definition for a `Date` class that represents a date -- that is, a year, month, and day of the month.
#
# 2. Write an `__init__` method that takes `year`, `month`, and `day` as parameters and assigns the parameters to attributes. Create an object that represents June 22, 1933.
#
# 3. Write `__str__` method that uses an f-string to format the attributes and returns the result. If you test it with the `Date` you created, the result should be `1933-06-22`.
#
# 4. Write a method called `is_after` that takes two `Date` objects and returns `True` if the first comes after the second. Create a second object that represents September 17, 1933, and check whether it comes after the first object.
#
# Hint: You might find it useful write a method called `to_tuple` that returns a tuple that contains the attributes of a `Date` object in year-month-day order.

# %%
# Solution

class Date:
    
    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year = year
        self.month = month
        self.day = day

    def __str__(date):
        s = f'{date.year}-{date.month:02d}-{date.day:02d}'
        return s

    def to_tuple(self):
        return self.year, self.month, self.day

    def is_after(self, other):
        t1 = self.to_tuple()
        t2 = other.to_tuple()
        return t1 > t2


# %% [markdown] tags=["remove-cell"]

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
birthday1.is_after(birthday2)  # should be False

# %% tags=["remove-cell"]
birthday2.is_after(birthday1)  # should be True
