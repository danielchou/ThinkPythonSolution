# ### Question
# Which of these types is used to represent a number with a fraction part?
# - [ ] `int`
# - [ ] `real`
# - [ ] `string`
# - [X] `float`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `int` values can only be integers.
# - Python does not have a type called `real`.
# - `string` values contain a sequence of characters.
# - `float` values represent floating-point numbers, which can have a fraction part.

# ### Question
# Which of these is a legal expression?
# 
# - [ ] `'1' / '2'`
# - [ ] `'1' * '2'`
# - [ ] `'1' / 2`
# - [X] `'1' * 2`
# 
# 
# ### Rationales
# - The division operator does not work with strings.
# - With the multiplication operator, the first value can be a string, but the second cannot.  
# - The division operator does not work with strings.
# - When the first operator is a string, the multiplication operator repeats the string, so the result is `'11'`.

# ### Question
# Which of these is the general word for any value used in a mathematical operation like addition or multiplication?
# 
# - [ ] term
# - [ ] factor
# - [ ] divisor
# - [X] operand
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A "term" is a value used in addition, but it is not the general word for any value used in an operation.
# - A "factor" is a value used in multiplication, but it is not the general word for any value used in an operation.
# - A "divisor" is one of the values used in division, but it is not the general word for any value used in an operation.
# - An "operand" is a value used in an operation.

# In[4]:
# ### Question
# On the internet, people sometimes argue about the value of an ambiguous mathematical expression like $8 ÷ 2(2+2)$. How do we write this expression in Python?
# 
# - [ ] `8 ÷ 2 (2 + 2)`
# - [ ] `8 / 2 (2 + 2)`
# - [ ] `8 ÷ 2 * (2 + 2)`
# - [X] `8 / 2 * (2 + 2)`
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The operator for division is `/`, not `÷`. Also, there is no implicit multiplication in Python -- you have to use the `*` operator.
# - There is no implicit multiplication in Python -- you have to use the `*` operator.
# - The operator for division is `/`, not `÷`.
# - An alternative is to put `8 / 2` in parentheses so the order of operations is clear.

# ### Question
# Which of these is a legal variable name?
# - [ ] `2pi`
# - [ ] `question?`
# - [ ] `import`
# - [X] `is_even`
# 
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `2pi` is not a legal variable name because it starts with a number.
# - `question?` is not a legal variable name because only letters, numbers, and the underscore character, `_`, are allowed.
# - `import` is not a legal variable name because it is one of Python's keywords.
# - `is_even` is a legal variable name because letters, numbers, and the underscore character, `_`, are allowed.

# ### Question
# Which of these is NOT a correct way to raise `2` to the third power?
# - [ ] `2 * 2 * 2` 
# - [ ] `2 ** 3`
# - [ ] `math.pow(2, 3`
# - [X] `2 ^ 3`
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Multiplication is a correct way to raise `2` to the third power.
# - The exponentiation operator, `**`,  is a correct way to raise `2` to the third power.
# - The `pow` function in the `math` module is a correct way to raise `2` to the third power.
# - In some languages, the `^` operator is used for exponentiation, but in Python it means something else.

# In[8]:
# ### Question
# When you call a function, what are the values that appear in parentheses?
# - [ ] assignments
# - [ ] comments
# - [ ] exceptions
# - [X] arguments
# 
# 
# ### Rationale 
# - An assignment is a statement that assigns a value to a variable.
# - A comment is text you add to a program to explain how it works.
# - An exception is an error detected while a program is running.
# - The values you pass to a function are called arguments.

# In[9]:
# ### Question
# If a program runs without producing an error message, but it does not do the right thing, what kind of error is that?
# - [ ] syntax error
# - [ ] runtime error
# - [ ] exception
# - [X] semantic error
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A syntax error produces an error message.
# - A runtime error produces an error message.
# - An exception produces an error message.
# - A semantic error is when a program runs, but does the wrong thing.

# ### Question
# When you define a function, what are the variables that appear in parentheses?
# - [ ] arguments
# - [ ] local variables
# - [ ] function objects
# - [X] parameters
# 
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - An argument is a value you provide when you call a function.
# - A local variable is a variable that gets assigned a value inside a function.
# - A function object is the result of defining a new function.
# - A parameter is a variable that gets a value when the function is called.

# In[12]:
# ### Question
# Which kind of statement can be used to run a line of code more than once?
# - [ ] assignment statement
# - [ ] import statement
# - [ ] print statement
# - [X] `for` statement
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable.
# - An import statement makes it possible to use functions in a module.
# - A print statement displays the value of an expression.
# - A `for` statement can run a line of code, or multiple lines, more than once.

# ### Question
# What is wrong with this function, if anything?
# 
# ```
# def bottle_line(n, suffix):
#     print(n)
#     print('bottles of beer')
#     print(suffix)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] Instead of `def`, the first word should be `define`.
# - [ ] You can't have more than one parameter in parentheses.
# - [ ] Only the first statement of the body should be indented.
# - [X] There are no errors in this function.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `def` is the right keyword to define a new function, although some other languages use `define`.
# - You can have any number of parameters in parentheses, including none.
# - All of the statements in the body of the function should be indented.
# - There is nothing wrong with this function.

# ### Question
# What is wrong with this function, if anything?
# 
# ```
# def square(length):
#     for i in range(4):
#         forward(50)
#         left(90)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] The indentation of the statements in the `for` loop is incorrect.
# - [ ] It does not bring the Turtle back to where it started.
# - [ ] There are no errors in this function.
# - [X] It always draws the same size square, regardless of `length`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The indentation in this function is correct.
# - The `Turtle` ends where it started, facing in the same direction.
# - There is an error!
# - The size is always `50` -- the value of `length` is never used.

# In[16]:
# ### Question
# What is it called when you put working statements into a new function definition?
# - [ ] generalization
# - [ ] indentation
# - [ ] debugging
# - [X] encapsulation
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Generalization is when you add a parameter to a function to make it more general.
# - You might have to indent the statements when you put them in a function definition, but that's not what the whole process is called.
# - If the statements are working, they don't have to be debugged.
# - Encapsulation is the process of transforming a sequence of statements into a function definition.

# ### Question
# Here are two versions of the `circle` function. 
# 
# ```
# def circle(radius):
#     circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
#     n = 30
#     length = circumference / n
#     polygon(n, length)
# 
# def circle(radius):
#     arc(radius,  360)
# ```
# 
# What can we say about these functions?
# 
# - [ ] They have the same implementation, but different interfaces.
# - [ ] They have the same interface _and_ the same implementation.
# - [ ] They have neither the same interface nor the same implementation.
# - [X] They have the same interface, but different implementations.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - They take the same parameter and have the same effect, so they have the same interface -- but they accomplish the effect in different ways, so they have different implementations.
# - They take the same parameter and have the same effect, so they have the same interface -- but they accomplish the effect in different ways, so they have different implementations.
# - They take the same parameter and have the same effect, so they have the same interface -- but they accomplish the effect in different ways, so they have different implementations.

# ### Question
# What is the result of these assignment statements?
# 
# ```
# a = 25 // 10
# b = 25 % 10
# ```
# - [ ] `a` is `2.5` and `b` is `5`
# - [ ] `a` is `2` and `b` is `250`
# - [ ] `a` is `2.5` and `b` is `250`
# - [X] `a` is `2` and `b` is `5`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The `//` operator does integer division, so `25 // 10` is `2`.
# - The `%` operator computes the remainder after division, so `25 % 10` is `5`.
# - The `//` operator does integer division, so `25 // 10` is `2`, and the `%` operator computes the remainder after division, so `25 % 10` is `5`.
# - The `//` operator does integer division and the `%` operator computes the remainder after division.

# In[20]:
# ### Question
# What is the result of these statements?
# ```
# x = 5
# print(x > 5)
# print(x <= 5)
# ```
# - [ ] They print the values `True` and `True`
# - [ ] They print the values `True` and `False`
# - [ ] They print the values `False` and `False`
# - [X] They print the values `False` and `True`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - If `x` is `5`, `x > 5` is the same as `5 > 5`, which is `False`.
# - If `x` is `5`, `x > 5` is the same as `5 > 5`, which is `False`; also, `x <= 5` is the same as `5 <= 5`, which is `True`.
# - If `x` is `5`, `x <= 5` is the same as `5 <= 5`, which is `True`.
# - If `x` is `5`, `x > 5` is `False` and `x <= 5` is `True`.

# ### Question
# What is the result of calling this function?
# ```
# def hello():
#     print('hello')
#     hello()
# ```
# - [ ] It prints `hello` once.
# - [ ] It prints `hello` forever.
# - [ ] It causes an error the first time `hello` tries to call itself.
# - [X] It prints `hello` many times and then causes an error.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - After it prints `hello` once, it calls itself, which prints `hello` many times and then causes a `RecursionError`.
# - After printing `hello` many times, it causes a `RecursionError`.
# - After printing `hello` many times, it causes a `RecursionError`.
# - After printing `hello` many times, it causes a `RecursionError`.

# ### Question
# What kind of operator is `or`?
# - [ ] arithmetic
# - [ ] bitwise
# - [ ] relational
# - [X] logical
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `or` is a logical operator, along with `and` and `not`.
# - `or` is a logical operator, along with `and` and `not`.
# - `or` is a logical operator, along with `and` and `not`.

# ### Question
# What is the return value if we call this function with the value `3`?
# 
# ```
# def collatz(x):
#     if x % 2 == 0:
#         return x // 2
#     else:
#         return x * 3 + 1
# ```
# 
# - [ ] `1`
# - [ ] `1.5`
# - [ ] It causes an error.
# - [X] `10`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Because `3 % 2` is `1`, the second branch of the conditional runs.
# - Because `3 % 2` is `1`, the second branch of the conditional runs. Also, because `//` does integer division, `3 // 2` is `1`.
# - This function works. Because `3 % 2` is `1`, the second branch of the conditional runs, and the result is `3 * 3 + 1`, which is `10`.
# - Because `3 % 2` is `1`, the second branch of the conditional runs, and the result is `3 * 3 + 1`, which is `10`.

# In[25]:
# ### Question
# What do we call a function that does not print anything or have any effect other than a return value?
# - [ ] recursive
# - [ ] dead code
# - [ ] incremental
# - [X] pure function
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A recursive function calls itself, but it might print something or have some other effect.
# - Dead code is code that can never run, often because it appears after a `print` statement.
# - Incremental development is a way of writing programs by making small changes and testing.
# - A pure function does not print anything or have any effect other than a return value.

# ### Question
# What is the result of calling this function with the values `x=1.5` and `y=1.6`?
# 
# ```
# def is_close(x, y):
#     return abs(x - y) < 0.2
# ```
# - [ ] There is a syntax error.
# - [ ] There is a runtime error.
# - [ ] `False`
# - [X] `True`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The syntax of the function is correct.
# - The function is correct as long as the values of `x` and `y` are numbers.
# - The absolute difference between `1.5` and `1.6` is `0.1`, which is less than `0.2`.
# - The absolute difference between `1.5` and `1.6` is `0.1`, which is less than `0.2`.

# ### Question
# This function is supposed to return `True` if `word` contains with `'A'` or `'a'`, and `False` otherwise. But it doesn't work -- What's wrong?
# 
# ```
# def has_a(word):
#     for letter in word.lower():
#         if letter == 'a':
#             return True
#         else:
#             return False
#         return False
# ```
# 
# - [ ] The first line of the for statement has a syntax error.
# - [ ] It only checks for lowercase `'a'`, not uppercase `'A'`.
# - [ ] It causes a runtime error if `word` is an empty string.
# - [X] It only checks the first letter of `word`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The syntax of the function is correct.
# - It uses `lower` to convert `word` to lowercase, so if uppercase `'A'` is in the string, it would be found.
# - If `word` is an empty string, the body of the loop never runs and the function returns `False`, which is correct.
# - Both branches of the conditional have `return` statements, so this function ends after checking the first letter.

# ### Question
# Which of these is a legal way to increment `x`, assuming it has already been assigned a value.
# - [ ] `x++`
# - [ ] `x + 1 = x`
# - [ ] `x = +1`
# - [X] `x = x + 1`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Some programming languages use the `++` operator to increment a variable, but not Python.
# - The left side of an assignment can't be an expression like `x + 1`.
# - The value `+1` is the same as `1`, so this statement assigns the value `1` to`x`.
# - This is a legal way to update the value of `x`.

# In[30]:
# ### Question
# What does this function do?
# 
# ```
# def check(word, letters):
#     for letter in word.lower():
#         if letter in letters.lower():
#             return False
#     return True
# ```
# - [ ] Returns `True` if any of the letters in `letters` appear in `word`.
# - [ ] Returns `True` if any of the letters in `word` appear in `letter`.
# - [ ] Returns `True` if none of the letters in `word` appear in `letter`.
# - [X] Returns `True` if none of the letters in `letters` appear in `word`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - It only returns `True` if it gets to the end of `word` and exits the loop having found none of the letters in `letters`.
# - It only returns `True` if it gets to the end of `word` and exits the loop having found none of the letters in `letters`.
# - It only returns `True` if it gets to the end of `word` and exits the loop having found none of the letters in `letters`.
# - It returns `True` if it gets to the end of `word` and exits the loop having found none of the letters in `letters`.

# ### Question
# What is the result of this comparison: `'Orange' < 'apple'`?
# - [ ] `False`
# - [ ] Syntax error
# - [ ] Runtime error, because you can't compare apples and oranges.
# - [X] `True`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - When we compare characters the uppercase `'O'` comes before the lowercase `'a'`.
# - The syntax is correct.
# - It's legal to compare any two strings.
# - Because when we compare characters the uppercase `'O'` comes before the lowercase `'a'`.

# ### Question
# Which of these is the correct way to invoke the `lower` method on a string called `s`?
# - [ ] lower(s)
# - [ ] string.lower(s)
# - [ ] s.lower(string)
# - [X] s.lower()
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The `lower` method can only be invoked on a string using dot notation.
# - The `lower` method can only be invoked on a string using dot notation.
# - The `lower` method doesn't take an argument in parentheses.
# - This is the correct syntax for invoking a method on an object.

# ### Question
# If we use the `search` function in the `re` module, which of the following strings matches this pattern: `r'ab?c$'`?
# - [ ] `'ab?c$'`
# - [ ] `'abcd'`
# - [ ] `'abbc'`
# - [X] `'zac'`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The question mark, `?`, and dollar sign, `$`, are special characters that change the behavior of the pattern -- they should not appear in the string.
# - The pattern `c$` requires the letter `c` at the end of the string.
# - The pattern `b?` means that `b` is optional, but it cannot be repeated.
# - It's OK to have extra letters at the beginning, and the `b` is not required.

# ```
# t = [1, 2, 3]
# t.pop(1)
# t.append(2)
# t.remove(3)
# ```
# - [ ] `[2, 2]`
# - [ ] `[1, 3]`
# - [ ] `[1, 2, 3]`
# - [X] `[1, 2]`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `t.pop(1)` removes the second element, which is `2`.
# - After `t.pop(1)` removes the second element, `t.append(2)` adds `2` to the end of the list, and `t.remove(3)` removes `3`.
# - `t.pop(1)` removes the second element, which is `2`. `t.append(2)` adds `2` to the end of the list, and `t.remove(3)` removes `3`.
# - `t.pop(1)` removes the second element, which is `2`. `t.append(2)` adds `2` to the end of the list, and `t.remove(3)` removes `3`.

# - [ ] `[1, 2]`
# - [ ] `[1, 2, 3]`
# - [ ] Runtime error
# - [X] `[1, 3]`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `a.remove(2)` removes the value `2` from the list.
# - `a` and `b` refer to the same object, so when we modify `a`, the value of `b` also changes.
# - These statements run without causing an error.
# - `a` and `b` refer to the same object, so when we modify `a`, the value of `b` also changes.

# - [ ] They are equivalent and identical.
# - [ ] They are identical but not equivalent.
# - [ ] They are not equivalent and not identical.
# - [X] They are equivalent but not identical.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `a` and `b` refer to different lists, so they are not identical.
# - `a` and `b` refer to lists with the same value, so they are equivalent, but they refer to different lists, so they are not identical.
# - `a` and `b` refer to lists with the same value, so they are equivalent, but they refer to different lists, so they are not identical.

# ```
# 
# - [ ] `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'a': 3}`
# - [ ] `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`
# - [ ] These statements cause a runtime error
# - [X] `{'a': 3, 'b': 2}`
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Each key can only appear once in a dictionary.
# - The second assignment statement changes the value associated with the key `'a'`.
# - This code runs without causing an error.
# - The second assignment statement updates the value associated with the key `'a'`.

# - [ ] `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}`
# - [ ] `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
# - [X] These statements cause a runtime error.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The `+=` operator looks up the key to get the old value before adding `1`.
# - The `+=` operator looks up the key to get the old value before adding `1`.
# - The `+=` operator looks up the key to get the old value before adding `1`.
# - Because `c` does not appear as a key in the dictionary, the second statement causes a `KeyError`.

# ### Question
# What happens when the following statements run?
# 
# ```
# d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
# d2 = {d1: 3}
# ```
# 
# - [ ] They add `d1` as a key in `d3`.
# - [ ] They cause a `KeyError` because `d1` is not in `d2`.
# - [ ] They cause a `ValueError` because `3` cannot appear as a value in a dictionary.
# - [X] They cause a `TypeError` because a dictionary cannot appear as a key in a dictionary.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Dictionaries are mutable, so they are not hashable, so they cannot appear as a key in a dictionary.
# - Dictionaries are mutable, so they are not hashable, so they cannot appear as a key in a dictionary, but that's not a `KeyError.`
# - Dictionaries are mutable, so they are not hashable, so they cannot appear as a key in a dictionary, but that's not a `ValueError.`

# Which one of these expressions is NOT a tuple?
# - [ ] `tuple('abc')`
# - [ ] `'abc',`
# - [ ] `('abc',)`
# - [X] `('abc')`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The value of this expression is a tuple with the elements `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
# - Because of the comma at the end, the value if this expression is a tuple with on element, `'abc'`.
# - Because of the comma, the value if this expression is a tuple with on element, `'abc'`. The parentheses are not required.
# - The parentheses alone do not make a tuple, so the value of this expression is just the string `'abc'`.

# - [ ] A syntax error because there should be a comma before the closing brace on the third line.
# - [X] A dictionary with one item that maps from a tuple to a list.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A tuple is immutable, so it can appear as a key in a dictionary -- as long as its elements are also immutable.
# - Any type can appear as a value in a dictionary, including lists.
# - The syntax is correct -- if there is a single item in a dictionary, a comma is legal but not required.
# - These statements create a dictionary with one item that maps from a tuple to a list.

# What does this function do?
# 
# ```
# def printall(*args):
#     for value in reversed(args):
#         print(value)
# ```
# - [ ] It has a syntax error because the `*` operator is not legal before a parameter.
# - [ ] It causes a `TypeError` because `args` is a tuple, which is immutable and cannot be reversed.
# - [ ] It takes a single list or tuple and prints the values in reversed order.
# - [X] It takes any number of arguments and prints them in reversed order.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - When the `*` operator appears before a parameter, it "packs" any number of arguments into a tuple.
# - It's true that `args` is a tuple, which is immutable, but `reversed` does not modify the tuple, it makes a new object that loops through the tuple in reverse order.
# - This function can take any number of arguments, not just a single argument.
# - It takes any number of arguments and "packs" them into a tuple, then loops through the tuple in reverse order and prints the elements.

# - [ ] `False` because `3` is greater than `1`.
# - [ ] These values can't be compared because `'a'` is less than `'b'`, but `3` is greater than `1`.
# - [ ] A `TypeError` because the `<` operator doesn't work with tuples.
# - [X] `True` because `'a'` is less than `'b'`.
# 
# ### Rationale
# - When tuples are compared, the first elements are compared first. The other elements are only compared if the first elements are the same.
# - When tuples are compared, the first elements are compared first. The other elements are only compared if the first elements are the same.
# - The `<` operator compares the first elements of each tuple, and then compares other elements in the event of a tie.

# 
# ```
# x = 1

# - It is legal -- and common -- for a class name and a variable to be the same word, but the class name starts with an uppercase letter.
# - The attributes of an object can be any time, and they don't have to be the same.

# ### Rationale
# - `time` is assigned to the first parameter of the method.
# - This method requires two arguments -- `time` is the first and `42` is the second.
# - Only one argument appears in parentheses, but `time` is passed to `increment` as the first argument.

# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The names of special methods like `__init__` begin and end with a two underscore characters. 
# - A triple-quoted string inside a class definition is a docstring that provides information about the class.

# - [ ] By default, all of the attributes are compared as if they were in a tuple.
# - [X] By default, the objects are equal only if they are identical.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - It is not an error -- if a class provides no `__eq__`, the `==` operator has a default behavior. 
# - If a class provides no `__eq__`, the `==` operator checks whether objects are identical. 
# - If a class provides no `__eq__`, the `==` operator checks whether objects are identical.

# - [ ] Every `Hand` object has the same attributes as every `Deck` object, no more or less.
# - [X] Every method defined in the `Deck` class can also be invoked on a `Hand` object.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - In this example, `Hand` inherits from `Deck`, so `Hand` is the child class and `Deck` is the parent.
# - If `Hand` inherits from `Deck`, it could have additional methods that don't work with `Deck`.
# - If `Hand` inherits from `Deck`, a `Hand` object should have all of the attributes of a `Deck` object, but it can have more.

# - [X] `True` because the elements of `'abba'` are a subset of the elements of `'abc'`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - With `set` objects, the `<=` operator checks whether one set is a subset of another -- it does not compare the length of the strings.
# - When the set is create, the duplicate elements of the string are removed.
# - The `set` function creates a new set -- it does not modify the string.

# ### Rationale
# - The result is a `Counter` object, not a tuple.
# - The result is a `Counter` object, not a dictionary.

# - [X] All `Game` objects created with the default value of `scores` refer to the same dictionary.  
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The default value of `scores` is a dictionary that is created when the function is defined. All `Game` objects created with the default value get a reference to it. 
# - All `Game` objects created with the default value get a reference to it, but a `Game` object that overrides `scores` will refer to a different dictionary.
# - The initial value of `scores` is an empty dictionary, but items might be added to it later.

# - [ ] `False` because there are not any numbers in the list that are not less than `10`.
# - [X] `True` because all numbers in the list are less than `10`. 
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of a sequence are `True`, and `False` otherwise.
# - The expression in parentheses is correct -- it is a generator expression, not a list comprehension.
# - The values produced by the generator expression are all `True`.

# - [ ] An error because a tuple cannot be used as a key in a `defaultdict`.
# - [ ] An error because we have to add the key to the `defaultdict` before we can look it up. 
# - [ ] `'woods'`
# - [X] `['woods']`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A tuple can appear as a key in a `defaultdict`, same as in a dictionary.
# - When you look up a key that is not already in this `defaultdict`, the key is added with a new empty list as the value.
# - When the key is added to the `defaultdict`, the corresponding value is an empty list. Then the `append` method add an element to the list.

# ### Rationale
# - In a parameter list, `**` is the pack operator, not the exponentiation operator.
# - The pack operator, `**`, packs the keyword arguments into a dictionary, not a list of tuples.
# - The pack operator, `**`, packs the keyword arguments into a dictionary, not a set and a list.

# ### Question
# What is the output of this program?
# 
# ```
# s = '3'
# str(s) * int(s)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] The integer `9`
# - [ ] The string `'9'`
# - [ ] The integer `333`
# - [X] The string `'333'`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `str(s)` is the string `'3'`, and `int(s)` is the integer `3`. See Chapter 1, "chaptertitle".
# - Multiplying a string by the integer `3` repeats the string three times. See Chapter 1, "chaptertitle".
# - When we multiply a string by an integer, the result is a string. See Chapter 1, "chaptertitle".
# - Multiplying a string by the integer `3` repeats the string three times. See Chapter 1, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# For this function to work without causing an error, what are the preconditions for `n`?
# 
# ```
# def countdown(n):
#     if n == 0:
#         print('Blastoff!')
#     else:
#         print(n)
#         countdown(n-1)
# ```
# 
# 
# - [ ] `n` must be a `float`.
# - [ ] `n` must be negative.
# - [ ] `n` must be strictly positive, not `0`.
# - [X] `n` must be a positive integer or `0`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `n` can be a `float` with no fraction part, but it can also be an `int`. See Chapter 5, "chaptertitle".
# - If `n` is negative, it recurses until the stack reaches its limit and causes a `RecursionError`. See Chapter 5, "chaptertitle".
# - If `n` is `0`, the function prints `'Blastoff!'` and returns without making a recursive call. See Chapter 5, "chaptertitle".
# - `n` must be non-negative -- that is, positive or `0`. See Chapter 5, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is wrong with the following program?
# 
# ```
# def compare(x, y):
#     if x < y:
#         return -1
#     else:
#         return 1    
#     return 0
# ```
# 
# - [ ] It has a syntax error because the last line is not indented.
# - [ ] It has a runtime error because the return value cannot be negative. 
# - [ ] It has a syntax error because it has more than one return statement.
# - [X] It has a logic error because the last line is dead code.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The syntax of the program is correct, but there is an error. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - Any value is a legal return value -- but there is a logic error because the last line can never run. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - The syntax of the program is correct, but there is a logic error because the last line can never run. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - There is a `return` statement in both branches of the `if` statement, so the last line can never run -- it is dead code. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is the output of this program, or is there an error?
# ```
# def rectangle_area(length, width):
#     return length * width
#     
# area = rectangle_area(3, 5)
# print(length)
# ```
# - [ ] `3` because the first argument gets assigned to `length`.
# - [ ] `5` because the second argument gets assigned to `length`.
# - [ ] Syntax error because there are two variables in the return statement.
# - [X] Runtime error because the parameter `length` does not exist outside the function.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `3` does get assigned to `length`, but the parameter only exists inside the function. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - The first argument gets assigned to `length`, but the parameter only exists inside the function. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - The variables are part of an arithmetic expression, which can be used in a return statement. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".
# - Parameters and local variables only exist inside the functions where they are defined. See Chapter 6, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is wrong with the following program?
# 
# ```
# s = int('123')
# for digit in s:
#     print(digit)
# ```
# 
# 
# - [ ] There is nothing wrong -- the program is correct.
# - [ ] `digit` is not a legal name for a loop variable.
# - [ ] `int` is a type, not a function.
# - [X] `s` is not a sequence, so we can't loop through its elements.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The program generates a `TypeError`. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - Any legal variable name can be used as a loop variable. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - `int` is a type, but it can be used as a function to convert other types to integers. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - `s` is an integer, which is not a sequence, so it can't be looped over. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".

# In[87]:
# ### Question
# Which of these is a correct way to convert a string to lowercase?
# 
# - [ ] `lower(str)`
# - [ ] `str = lower(str)`
# - [ ] `str.lower()`
# - [X] `str = str.lower()`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `lower` is a method, so it has to be invoked on a string, as in `str.lower()`; and it creates a new string, which should be assigned to a variable. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - `lower` is a method, so it has to be invoked on a string, as in `str.lower()`. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - `str.lower()` creates a new string, but if the string is not assigned to a variable, there is no way to access it. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - `str.lower()` creates a new string -- if we assign it back to `str`, the new string replaces the old one. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".

# In[88]:
# ### Question
# The following function takes two strings as parameters and returns a string.
# Which of the following docstrings is a correct description of what this function does?
# 
# ```
# def compute(word1, word2):
#     t = []
#     for letter in word1:
#         if letter in word2:
#             t.append(letter)
#     return ''.join(t)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] Returns the letters that appear in either `word1` or `word2` or both.
# - [ ] Returns the letters that appear in either `word1` or `word2` but not both.
# - [ ] Returns the letters that appear in `word1` but not  `word2`.
# - [X] Returns the letters that appear in both `word1` and `word2`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - In order to get to the `append` method, `letter` has to appear in both words. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - In order to get to the `append` method, `letter` has to appear in both words. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - In order to get to the `append` method, `letter` has to appear in both words. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".
# - This function returns a string that contains the letters that appear in both `word1` and `word2`. See Chapter 7, "chaptertitle".

# In[89]:
# ### Question
# This function is intended to convert the first letter of a word to lowercase and the rest of the letters to uppercase.
# 
# ```
# def lower_upper(word):
#     first = word[0]
#     rest = word[1:]
#     word = first.lower() + rest.upper()
# ```
# 
# What is the value of `word` if we call this function like this -- or is there an error?
# 
# ```
# word = lower_upper('Python')
# ```
# 
# - [ ] The result is a syntax error because a `:` character cannot appear inside the bracket operator.
# - [ ] The result is a runtime error because `0` is not a valid index.
# - [ ] The program is correct -- the value of `word` is `'pYTHON'`.
# - [X] The program contains a logic error -- the value of `word` is `None`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - A colon inside a bracket operator indicates a slice -- in this case, it selects all characters from the second to the end. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".
# - `0` is a valid index -- it select the first character in the string. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".
# - The function has no return statement, so it returns `None`. Assigning a new value to the parameter `word` has no effect outside the function. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".
# - The function has no return statement, so it returns `None`. Assigning a new value to the parameter `word` has no effect outside the function. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# If we use the `search` function in the `re` module, which of the following strings matches this pattern: `r'^a(bc|de)f$'`?
# - [ ] `'abcdef'`
# - [ ] `'zadef'`
# - [ ] `'abc'`
# - [X] `'adef'`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The pattern `'(bc|de)'` requires either `'bc'` or `'de'` but not both. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".
# - The pattern `^a` requires the letter `a` at the beginning of the string. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".
# - The pattern `f$` requires the letter `f` at the end of the string. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".
# - This string has `'a'` at the beginning `'f'` at the end, and `'de'` in the middle. See Chapter 8, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is the result of this program?
# 
# ```
# t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# t[1:-1]
# ```
# 
# - [ ] An `IndexError` because `-1` is not a legal index.
# - [ ] `[1, 2, 3]`
# - [ ] `[2, 3, 4]`
# - [X] `[2, 3]`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Negative indices count backward from the end of the sequence, so the slice index `1:-1` selects elements from the second to the second-to-last, including both. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".
# - The slice index `1:-1` excludes the first element of the list. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".
# - The slice index `1:-1` excludes the last element of the list. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".
# - The slice index `1:-1` selects elements from the second to the second-to-last, including both. See Chapter 9, "chaptertitle".

# In[92]:
# ### Question
# After these statements run, what are the values of `a` and `b`, or is there an error?
# 
# ```
# a, b = 1, 2
# a, b = b, a
# ```
# 
# - [ ] There is a runtime error because the values on the right are tuples.
# - [ ] There is a syntax error because the assignment statement has more than one variable.
# - [ ] `a` is `1` and `b` is `2`.
# - [X] `a` is `2` and `b` is `1`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The values on the right are tuples, but these are legal assignment statements. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - An assignment statement can have a tuple of variables on the left. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - After the first assignment `a` is `1` and `b` is `2`, but the second assignment swaps the values. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - After the first assignment `a` is `1` and `b` is `2`, and then the second assignment swaps the values. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# Why can't a list appear as a key in a dictionary?
# 
# - [ ] The elements in a list might not be totally ordered.
# - [ ] The elements in a list can be different types.
# - [ ] Lists can contain any number of elements.
# - [X] Lists are mutable, which makes them unhashable.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - If the elements of a list are not totally ordered, they are not sortable, but that's not the reason a list can't appear as a key in a dictionary. See Chapter 10, "chaptertitle" and Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - The elements in a list can be different types, but that's not the reason a list can't appear as a key in a dictionary. See Chapter 10, "chaptertitle" and Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - Lists can contain any number of elements, but that's not the reason a list can't appear as a key in a dictionary. See Chapter 10, "chaptertitle" and Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - If an object is mutable, it isn't hashable, which means it can't be used as a key in a dictionary. See Chapter 10, "chaptertitle" and Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".

# In[94]:
# ### Question
# What is the primary difference between a list and a tuple?
# - [ ] A list can contain any type; a tuple can only contain hashable types.
# - [ ] A tuple can contain any type; a list can only contain hashable types.
# - [ ] A tuple is mutable; a list is immutable.
# - [X] A list is mutable; a tuple is immutable.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Both lists and tuples can contain any type. Keys in dictionaries must be hashable. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - Both lists and tuples can contain any type. Keys in dictionaries must be hashable. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - It's the other way around: a list is mutable; a tuple is immutable. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - A tuple is immutable. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".

# In[95]:
# ### Question
# Which of these is a correct way to reverse the elements of a list in place -- that is, by modifying an existing list without creating a new list?
# 
# - [ ] `t = reversed(t)`
# - [ ] `reversed(t)`
# - [ ] `t = t.reverse()`
# - [X] `t.reverse()`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - This statement works, but it creates a new list and does not modify `t`. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - `reverse(t)` creates a new list, but if the list is not assigned to a variable, there is no way to access it. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - The return value from `t.reverse()` is `None`, so this statement sets `t` to `None`. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".
# - `t.reverse()` reverses the elements of `t` without creating a new list. See Chapter 11, "chaptertitle".

# In[96]:
# ### Question
# What is the result of this program?
# 
# ```
# s = ['bbb', 'aa', 'c']
# sorted(s, key=len, reverse=True)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] `['aa', 'bbb', 'c']`
# - [ ] `['c', 'aa', 'bbb']`
# - [ ] `['c', 'bbb', 'aa']`
# - [X] `['bbb', 'aa', 'c']`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - `key=len` sorts by length, rather than alphabetical order, and `reverse=True` sorts in descending order. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - `reverse=True` sorts in descending order. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - `key=len` sorts by length, rather than alphabetical order. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - `key=len` sorts by length, rather than alphabetical order, and `reverse=True` sorts in descending order, so the result is `['bbb', 'aa', 'c']`. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What does the following function do?
# ```
# def compute(d1, d2):
#     res = {}
#     for key in d1:
#         res[key] = d1[key]
#     for key in d2:
#         res[key] = d2[key]
#     return res
# ```
# 
# - [ ] Adds the keys from `d1` to `d2`.
# - [ ] Adds the keys from `d2` to `d1`.
# - [ ] Makes a new dictionary with all keys that are in both `d1` and `d2`.
# - [X] Makes a new dictionary with all keys that are in either `d1` or `d2`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - This function makes and returns a new dictionary. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - This function makes and returns a new dictionary. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - The new dictionary has all keys from either dictionary. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".
# - The new dictionary has all keys from either dictionary. If the same key appears in both, it gets the value from `d2`. See Chapter 12, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# Suppose we run the following program to get the current working directory:
# 
# ```
# import os
# 
# os.getcwd()
# ```
# 
# And the result is `/home/dinsdale/photos`.
# Now suppose we run the following program to check for the existence of a file:
# 
# ```
# os.path.exists('apr-2023/photo1.jpg')
# ```
# 
# What is the absolute path of the file that gets checked?
# 
# - [ ] `'photo1.jpg'`
# - [ ] `'apr-2023/photo1.jpg'`
# - [ ] `'/home/dinsdale/photo1.jpg'`
# - [X] `'/home/dinsdale/photos/apr-2023/photo1.jpg'`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - Because `'apr-2023/photo1.jpg'` is a relative path, it gets joined to the current working directory. See Chapter 13, "chaptertitle".
# - Because `'apr-2023/photo1.jpg'` is a relative path, it gets joined to the current working directory. See Chapter 13, "chaptertitle".
# - Because `'apr-2023/photo1.jpg'` is a relative path, it gets joined to the current working directory. See Chapter 13, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is the result of this program?
# ```
# class Day:
#     def __init__(self, day):
#         self.day = day
# 
#     def __str__(date):
#         return f'Today is {date.day}'
#     
# print(Day('Wednesday'))
# ```
# - [ ] `f'Today is Wednesday'`
# - [ ] `'Today is {Wednesday}'`
# - [ ] `f'Today is {date.day}'`
# - [X] `'Today is Wednesday'`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The `f` before the string indicates that it is a format string. See Chapter 15, "chaptertitle".
# - The curly braces don't appear in the return value. See Chapter 15, "chaptertitle".
# - The `f` before the string indicates that it is a format string, and the expression in curly braces gets replaced by its value. See Chapter 15, "chaptertitle".
# - In a format string, the expression in curly braces gets replaced by its value. See Chapter 15, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# Assuming that the `Animal` class exists, what is the output of this program?
# 
# ```
# class Cat(Animal):
#     """Represents a cat."""
#     
# cat = Cat()
# isinstance(cat, Animal)
# ```
# 
# - [ ] `False` because an instance of a parent class is not an instance of the child class.
# - [ ] `False` because an instance of a child class is not an instance of the parent class.
# - [ ] `True` because every instance of a parent class is also an instance of the child class.
# - [X] `True` because every instance of a child class is also an instance of the parent class.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - It's true that an instance of a parent class is not an instance of the child class, but that's not what's being checked here. See Chapter 17, "chaptertitle".
# - Every instance of a child class is also an instance of the parent class. See Chapter 17, "chaptertitle".
# - An instance of a parent class is not an instance of the child class. See Chapter 17, "chaptertitle".
# - In this example, `Cat` is a child class of `Animal`, so every `Cat` object is also an instance of `Animal`. See Chapter 17, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# What is the result of this program?
# 
# ```
# from collections import namedtuple
# 
# Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
# p = Point(3, 4)
# p[1]
# ```
# 
# - [ ] `AttributeError` because the attributes of `p` are `x` and `y`.
# - [ ] `IndexError` because the attributes of `p` are `x` and `y`.
# - [ ] `3` because `p` is a `namedtuple` and the element with index `1` is `3`.
# - [X] `4` because `p` is a `namedtuple` and the element with index `1` is `4`.
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - The attributes of `p` are `x` and `y`, but because `p` is a `namedtuple`, we can use the  bracket operator to access the elements by index. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - The attributes of `p` are `x` and `y`, but because `p` is a `namedtuple`, we can use the  bracket operator to access the elements by index. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - In a named tuple -- as in a tuple -- the index of the first element is `0`. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - In a named tuple -- as in a tuple -- the index of the second element is `1`. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".

# ### Question
# We can call the built-in function `round` like this:
# 
# ```
# import math
# 
# round(math.pi, ndigits=3)
# ```
# 
# The result is the value of `math.pi` round off to three decimal places.
# Now suppose we have the positional argument in a tuple and the keyword argument in a dictionary, like this:
# 
# ```
# args = (math.pi,)
# kwargs = {"ndigits": 3}
# ```
# 
# Which of these is a correct way to call `round` and get the same result?
# 
# - [ ] `round(args, kwargs)`
# - [ ] `round(*args, *kwargs)`
# - [ ] `round(**args, **kwargs)`
# - [X] `round(*args, **kwargs)`
# 
# 
# ### Rationale
# - In order to pass the elements of `args` as positional arguments, we have to unpack them with the `*` operator. Similarly, to pass the items in `kwargs` as keyword arguments, we have to unpack them with the `**` operator. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - To pass the items in `kwargs` as keyword arguments, we have to unpack them with the `**` operator. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - To pass the elements of `args` as positional arguments, we have to unpack them with the `*` operator. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
# - The `*` operator unpacks the elements of `args` and the `**` operator unpacks the items in `kwargs`. See Chapter 18, "chaptertitle".
