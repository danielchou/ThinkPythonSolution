# # Final thoughts

# In[2]:
# Learning to program is not easy, but if you made it this far, you are off to a good start.
# Now I have some suggestions for ways you can keep learning and apply what you have learned.
# 
# This book is meant to be a general introduction to programming, so we have not focused on specific applications.
# Depending on your interests, there are any number of areas where you can apply your new skills.
# 
# If you are interested in Data Science, there are three books of mine you might like:
# 
# * *Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis*, O'Reilly Media, 2014.
# 
# * *Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics in Python*, O'Reilly Media, 2021.
# 
# * *Think DSP: Digital Signal Processing in Python*, O'Reilly Media, 2016.

# In[3]:
# If you are interested in physical modeling and complex systems, you might like:
# 
# * *Modeling and Simulation in Python: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers*, No Starch Press, 2023.
# 
# * *Think Complexity: Complexity Science and Computational Modeling*, O'Reilly Media, 2018.
# 
# These use NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and other Python libraries for data science and scientific computing.

# In[4]:
# This book tries to find a balance between general principles of programming and details of Python.
# As a result, it does not include every feature of the Python language.
# For more about Python, and good advice about how to use it, I recommend *Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming*, second edition by Luciano Ramalho, O'Reilly Media, 2022.
# 
# After an introduction to programming, a common next step is to learn about data structures and algorithms.
# I have a work in progress on this topic, called *Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python*.
# A free electronic version is available from Green Tea Press at <https://greenteapress.com>.

# As you work on more complex programs, you will encounter new challenges.
# You might find it helpful to review the sections in this book about debugging.
# In particular, remember the Six R's of debugging from [Chapter 12](section_debugging_12): reading, running, ruminating, rubber-ducking, retreating, and resting.
# 
# This book suggests tools to help with debugging, including the `print` and `repr` functions, the `structshape` function in [Chapter 11](section_debugging_11) -- and the built-in functions `isinstance`, `hasattr`, and `vars` in [Chapter 14](section_debugging_14).

# In[6]:
# It also suggests tools for testing programs, including the `assert` statement, the `doctest` module, and the `unittest` module.
# Including tests in your programs is one of the best ways to prevent and detect errors, and save time debugging.
# 
# But the best kind of debugging is the kind you don't have to do.
# If you use an incremental development process as described in [Chapter 6](section_incremental) -- and test as you go -- you will make fewer errors and find them more quickly when you do.
# Also, remember encapsulation and generalization from [Chapter 4](section_encapsulation), which is particularly useful when you are developing code in Jupyter notebooks.

# In[7]:
# Throughout this book, I've suggested ways to use virtual assistants to help you learn, program, and debug.
# I hope you are finding these tools useful.
# 
# In additional to virtual assistants like ChatGPT, you might also want to use a tool like Copilot that autocompletes code as you type.
# I did not recommend using these tools, initially, because they can be overwhelming for beginners.
# But you might want to explore them now.
# 
# Using AI tools effectively requires some experimentation and reflection to find a flow that works for you.
# If you think it's a nuisance to copy code from ChatGPT to Jupyter, you might prefer something like Copilot.
# But the cognitive work you do to compose a prompt and interpret the response can be as valuable as the code the tool generates, in the same vein as rubber duck debugging.

# In[8]:
# As you gain programming experience, you might want to explore other development environments.
# I think Jupyter notebooks are a good place to start, but they are relatively new and not as widely-used as conventional integrated development environments (IDE).
# For Python, the most popular IDEs include PyCharm and Spyder -- and Thonny, which is often recommended for beginners.
# Other IDEs, like Visual Studio Code and Eclipse, work with other programming languages as well.
# Or, as a simpler alternative, you can write Python programs using any text editor you like.
# 
# As you continue your programming journey, you don't have to go alone!
# If you live in or near a city, there's a good chance there is a Python user group you can join.
# These groups are usually friendly to beginners, so don't be afraid.
# If there is no group near you, you might be able to join events remotely.
# Also, keep an eye out for regional Python conferences.

# In[9]:
# One of the best ways to improve your programming skills is to learn another language.
# If you are interested in statistics and data science, you might want to learn R.
# But I particularly recommend learning a functional language like Racket or Elixir.
# Functional programming requires a different kind of thinking, which changes the way you think about programs.
# 
# Good luck!
