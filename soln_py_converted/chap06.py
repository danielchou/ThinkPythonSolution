# # Return Values
# 
# In previous chapters, we've used built-in functions -- like `abs` and `round` -- and functions in the math module -- like `sqrt` and `pow`.
# When you call one of these functions, it returns a value you can assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.
# 
# The functions we have written so far are different.
# Some use the `print` function to display values, and some use turtle functions to draw figures.
# But they don't return values we assign to variables or use in expressions.
# 
# In this chapter, we'll see how to write functions that return values.

# In[3]:
# ## Some functions have return values
# 
# When you call a function like `math.sqrt`, the result is called a **return value**.
# If the function call appears at the end of a cell, Jupyter displays the return value immediately.

# In[4]:
import math

math.sqrt(42 / math.pi)

# In[5]:
# If you assign the return value to a variable, it doesn't get displayed.

# In[6]:
radius = math.sqrt(42 / math.pi)

# In[7]:
# But you can display it later.

# In[8]:
radius

# In[9]:
# Or you can use the return value as part of an expression.

# In[10]:
radius + math.sqrt(42 / math.pi)

# In[11]:
# Here's an example of a function that returns a value.

# In[12]:
def circle_area(radius):
    area = math.pi * radius**2
    return area

# In[13]:
# `circle_area` takes `radius` as a parameter and computes the area of a circle with that radius.
# 
# The last line is a `return` statement that returns the value of `area`.
# 
# If we call the function like this, Jupyter displays the return value.

# In[14]:
circle_area(radius)

# In[15]:
# We can assign the return value to a variable.

# In[16]:
a = circle_area(radius)

# In[17]:
# Or use it as part of an expression.

# In[18]:
circle_area(radius) + 2 * circle_area(radius / 2)

# In[19]:
# Later we can display the value of the variable we assigned the result to.

# In[20]:
a

# In[21]:
# But we can't access `area`.

# In[22]:
%%expect NameError

area

# In[23]:
# `area` is a local variable in a function, so we can't access it from outside the function.

# In[24]:
# ## And some have None
# 
# If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it returns `None`, which is a special value like `True` and `False`.
# For example, here's the `repeat` function from Chapter 3.

# In[25]:
def repeat(word, n):
    print(word * n)

# In[26]:
# If we call it like this, it displays the first line of the Monty Python song "Finland".

# In[27]:
repeat('Finland, ', 3)

# In[28]:
# This function uses the `print` function to display a string, but it does not use a `return` statement to return a value.
# If we assign the result to a variable, it displays the string anyway. 

# In[29]:
result = repeat('Finland, ', 3)

# In[30]:
# And if we display the value of the variable, we get nothing.

# In[31]:
result

# In[32]:
# `result` actually has a value, but Jupyter doesn't show it.
# However, we can display it like this.

# In[33]:
print(result)

# In[34]:
# The return value from `repeat` is `None`.
# 
# Now here's a function similar to `repeat` except that has a return value.

# In[35]:
def repeat_string(word, n):
    return word * n

# In[36]:
# Notice that we can use an expression in a `return` statement, not just a variable.
# 
# With this version, we can assign the result to a variable.
# When the function runs, it doesn't display anything.

# In[37]:
line = repeat_string('Spam, ', 4)

# In[38]:
# But later we can display the value assigned to `line`.

# In[39]:
line

# In[40]:
# A function like this is called a **pure function** because it doesn't display anything or have any other effect -- other than returning a value.

# In[41]:
# ## Return values and conditionals
# 
# If Python did not provide `abs`, we could write it like this.

# In[42]:
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x

# In[43]:
# If `x` is negative, the first `return` statement returns `-x` and the function ends immediately.
# Otherwise, the second `return` statement returns `x` and the function ends.
# So this function is correct.
# 
# However, if you put `return` statements in a conditional, you have to make sure that every possible path through the program hits a `return` statement.
# For example, here's an incorrect version of `absolute_value`.

# In[44]:
def absolute_value_wrong(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    if x > 0:
        return x

# In[45]:
# Here's what happens if we call this function with `0` as an argument.

# In[46]:
absolute_value_wrong(0)

# In[47]:
# We get nothing! Here's the problem: when `x` is `0`, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a `return` statement, which means that the return value is `None`, so Jupyter displays nothing.
# 
# As another example, here's a version of `absolute_value` with an extra `return` statement at the end.

# In[48]:
def absolute_value_extra_return(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x
    
    return 'This is dead code'

# In[49]:
# If `x` is negative, the first `return` statement runs and the function ends.
# Otherwise the second `return` statement runs and the function ends.
# Either way, we never get to the third `return` statement -- so it can never run.
# 
# Code that can never run is called **dead code**.
# In general, dead code doesn't do any harm, but it often indicates a misunderstanding, and it might be confusing to someone trying to understand the program.

# In[50]:
# ## Incremental development
# 
# As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more
# time debugging.
# To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try **incremental development**, which is a way of adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
# 
# As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points represented by the coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.
# By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:
# 
# $$\mathrm{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$ 
# 
# The first step is to consider what a `distance` function should look like in Python -- that is, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?
# 
# For this function, the inputs are the coordinates of the points.
# The return value is the distance.
# Immediately you can write an outline of the function:

# In[51]:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return 0.0

# In[52]:
# This version doesn't compute distances yet -- it always returns zero.
# But it is a complete function with a return value, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.
# 
# To test the new function, we'll call it with sample arguments:

# In[53]:
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[54]:
# I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is `3` and the
# vertical distance is `4`.
# That way, the result is `5`, the hypotenuse of a `3-4-5` right triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.
# 
# At this point we have confirmed that the function runs and returns a value, and we can start adding code to the body.
# A good next step is to find the differences `x2 - x1` and `y2 - y1`. 
# Here's a version that stores those values in temporary variables and displays them.

# In[55]:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print('dx is', dx)
    print('dy is', dy)
    return 0.0

# In[56]:
# If the function is working, it should display `dx is 3` and `dy is 4`.
# If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and
# performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few
# lines to check.

# In[57]:
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[58]:
# Good so far. Next we compute the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`:

# In[59]:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    print('dsquared is: ', dsquared)
    return 0.0

# In[60]:
# Again, we can run the function and check the output, which should be `25`. 

# In[61]:
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[62]:
# Finally, we can use `math.sqrt` to compute the distance:

# In[63]:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    print("result is", result)

# In[64]:
# And test it.

# In[65]:
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[66]:
# The result is correct, but this version of the function displays the result rather than returning it, so the return value is `None`.
# 
# We can fix that by replacing the `print` function with a `return` statement.

# In[67]:
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    return result

# In[68]:
# This version of `distance` is a pure function.
# If we call it like this, only the result is displayed.

# In[69]:
distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[70]:
# And if we assign the result to a variable, nothing is displayed.

# In[71]:
d = distance(1, 2, 4, 6)

# In[72]:
# The `print` statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once the function is working, we can remove them. 
# Code like that is called **scaffolding** because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.
# 
# This example demonstrates incremental development.
# The key aspects of this process are:
# 
# 1.  Start with a working program, make small changes, and test after every change.
# 
# 2.  Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.
# 
# 3.  Once the program is working, remove the scaffolding.
# 
# At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
# Incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.

# In[73]:
# ## Boolean functions
# 
# Functions can return the boolean values `True` and `False`, which is often convenient for encapsulating a complex test in a function.
# For example, `is_divisible` checks whether `x` is divisible by `y` with no remainder.

# In[74]:
def is_divisible(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# In[75]:
# Here's how we use it.

# In[76]:
is_divisible(6, 4)

# In[77]:
is_divisible(6, 3)

# In[78]:
# Inside the function, the result of the `==` operator is a boolean, so we can write the
# function more concisely by returning it directly.

# In[79]:
def is_divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0

# In[80]:
# Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements.

# In[81]:
if is_divisible(6, 2):
    print('divisible')

# In[82]:
# It might be tempting to write something like this:

# In[83]:
if is_divisible(6, 2) == True:
    print('divisible')

# In[84]:
# But the comparison is unnecessary.

# In[85]:
# ## Recursion with return values
# 
# Now that we can write functions with return values, we can write recursive functions with return values, and with that capability, we have passed an important threshold -- the subset of Python we have is now **Turing complete**, which means that we can perform any computation that can be described by an algorithm.
# 
# To demonstrate recursion with return values, we'll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical functions.
# A recursive definition is similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition refers to the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful:
# 
# > vorpal: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.
# 
# If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. 
# On the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol $!$, you might get something like this: 
# 
# $$\begin{aligned}
# 0! &= 1 \\
# n! &= n~(n-1)!
# \end{aligned}$$ 
# 
# This definition says that the factorial of $0$ is $1$, and the factorial of any other value, $n$, is $n$ multiplied by the factorial of $n-1$.
# 
# If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can write a Python program to evaluate it. 
# Following an incremental development process, we'll start with a function that take `n` as a parameter and always returns `0`.

# In[86]:
def factorial(n):
    return 0

# In[87]:
# Now let's add the first part of the definition -- if the argument happens to be `0`, all we have to do is return `1`:

# In[88]:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

# In[89]:
# Now let's fill in the second part -- if `n` is not `0`, we have to make a recursive
# call to find the factorial of `n-1` and then multiply the result by `n`:

# In[90]:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        return n * recurse

# In[91]:
# The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of `countdown` in Chapter 5.
# If we call `factorial` with the value `3`:
# 
# Since `3` is not `0`, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
# of `n-1`\...
# 
# > Since `2` is not `0`, we take the second branch and calculate the
# > factorial of `n-1`\...
# >
# > > Since `1` is not `0`, we take the second branch and calculate the
# > > factorial of `n-1`\...
# > >
# > > > Since `0` equals `0`, we take the first branch and return `1` without
# > > > making any more recursive calls.
# > >
# > > The return value, `1`, is multiplied by `n`, which is `1`, and the
# > > result is returned.
# >
# > The return value, `1`, is multiplied by `n`, which is `2`, and the result
# > is returned.
# 
# The return value `2` is multiplied by `n`, which is `3`, and the result,
# `6`, becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole
# process.
# 
# The following figure shows the stack diagram for this sequence of function calls.

# In[92]:
from diagram import Frame, Stack, make_binding

main = Frame([], name='__main__', loc='left')
frames = [main]

ns = 3, 2, 1
recurses = 2, 1, 1
results = 6, 2, 1

for n, recurse, result in zip(ns, recurses, results):
    binding1 = make_binding('n', n)
    binding2 = make_binding('recurse', recurse)
    frame = Frame([binding1, binding2], 
                  name='factorial', value=result,
                  loc='left', dx=1.2)
    frames.append(frame)
    
binding1 = make_binding('n', 0)
frame = Frame([binding1], name='factorial', value=1, 
              shim=1.2, loc='left', dx=1.4)
frames.append(frame)

stack = Stack(frames, dy=-0.45)

# In[93]:
from diagram import diagram, adjust

width, height, x, y = [2.74, 2.26, 0.73, 2.05]
ax = diagram(width, height)
bbox = stack.draw(ax, x, y)
# adjust(x, y, bbox)

# In[94]:
# The return values are shown being passed back up the stack.
# In each frame, the return value is the product of `n` and `recurse`.
# 
# In the last frame, the local variable `recurse` does not exist because the branch that creates it does not run.

# In[95]:
# ## Leap of faith
# 
# Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the "leap of faith". When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you *assume* that the function works correctly and returns the right result.
# 
# In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions.
# When you call `abs` or `math.sqrt`, you don't examine the bodies of those functions -- you just assume that they work.
# 
# The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, earlier we wrote a function called `is_divisible` that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we convince ourselves that this function is correct, we can use it without looking at the body again.
# 
# The same is true of recursive programs.
# When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works and then ask yourself, "Assuming that I can compute the factorial of $n-1$, can I compute the factorial of $n$?"
# The recursive definition of factorial implies that you can, by multiplying by $n$.
# 
# Of course, it's a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven't finished writing it, but that's why it's called a leap of faith!

# In[96]:
# ## Fibonacci
# 
# After `factorial`, the most common example of a recursive function is `fibonacci`, which has the following definition: 
# 
# $$\begin{aligned}
# \mathrm{fibonacci}(0) &= 0 \\
# \mathrm{fibonacci}(1) &= 1 \\
# \mathrm{fibonacci}(n) &= \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-1) + \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-2)
# \end{aligned}$$ 
# 
# Translated into Python, it looks like this:

# In[97]:
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif  n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# In[98]:
# If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for small values of $n$, your head explodes.
# But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work correctly, you can be confident that the last `return` statement is correct.
# 
# As an aside, this way of computing Fibonacci numbers is very inefficient.
# In [Chapter 10](section_memos) I'll explain why and suggest a way to improve it.

# In[99]:
# ## Checking types
# 
# What happens if we call `factorial` and give it `1.5` as an argument?

# In[100]:
%%expect RecursionError

factorial(1.5)

# In[101]:
# It looks like an infinite recursion. How can that be? The function has base cases when `n == 1` or `n == 0`.
# But if `n` is not an integer, we can *miss* the base case and recurse forever.
# 
# In this example, the initial value of `n` is `1.5`.
# In the first recursive call, the value of `n` is `0.5`.
# In the next, it is `-0.5`. 
# From there, it gets smaller (more negative), but it will never be `0`.
# 
# To avoid infinite recursion we can use the built-in function `isinstance` to check the type of the argument.
# Here's how we check whether a value is an integer.

# In[102]:
isinstance(3, int)

# In[103]:
isinstance(1.5, int)

# In[104]:
# Now here's a version of `factorial` with error-checking.

# In[105]:
def factorial(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        print('factorial is only defined for integers.')
        return None
    elif n < 0:
        print('factorial is not defined for negative numbers.')
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# In[106]:
# First it checks whether `n` is an integer.
# If not, it displays an error message and returns `None`.
# 

# In[107]:
factorial('crunchy frog')

# In[108]:
# Then it checks whether `n` is negative.
# If so, it displays an error message and returns `None.`

# In[109]:
factorial(-2)

# In[110]:
# If we get past both checks, we know that `n` is a non-negative integer, so we can be confident the recursion will terminate.
# Checking the parameters of a function to make sure they have the correct types and values is called **input validation**.

# In[111]:
# ## Debugging
# 
# Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging.
# If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:
# 
# -   There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting -- that is, a precondition is violated.
# 
# -   There is something wrong with the function -- that is, a postcondition is violated.
# 
# -   The caller is doing something wrong with the return value.
# 
# To rule out the first possibility, you can add a `print` statement at the beginning of the function that displays the values of the parameters (and maybe their types).
# Or you can write code that checks the preconditions explicitly.
# 
# If the parameters look good, you can add a `print` statement before each `return` statement and display the return value.
# If possible, call the function with arguments that make it easy check the result. 
# 
# If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value is being used correctly -- or used at all!
# 
# Adding `print` statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of execution more visible.
# For example, here is a version of `factorial` with print statements:

# In[112]:
def factorial(n):
    space = ' ' * (4 * n)
    print(space, 'factorial', n)
    if n == 0:
        print(space, 'returning 1')
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        print(space, 'returning', result)
        return result

# In[113]:
# `space` is a string of space characters that controls the indentation of
# the output. Here is the result of `factorial(3)` :

# In[114]:
factorial(3)

# In[115]:
# If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of output can be helpful.
# It takes some time to develop effective scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging.

# ### Exercise
# 
# Use incremental development to write a function called `hypot` that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments.
# 
# Note: There's a function in the math module called `hypot` that does the same thing, but you should not use it for this exercise!
# 
# Even if you can write the function correctly on the first try, start with a function that always returns `0` and practice making small changes, testing as you go.
# When you are done, the function should only return a value -- it should not display anything.

# ### Exercise
# 
# The greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$ is the largest number
# that divides both of them with no remainder.
# 
# One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that
# if $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$, then $gcd(a,
# b) = gcd(b, r)$. As a base case, we can use $gcd(a, 0) = a$.
# 
# Write a function called `gcd` that takes parameters `a` and `b` and
# returns their greatest common divisor.

# Solution
