# # *Think Python* on Jupyter
# 
# This is an introduction to Jupyter notebooks for people reading the third edition of [*Think Python*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition) by Allen B. Downey.
# 
# A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains text, code, and results from running the code.
# You can read a notebook like a book, but you can also run the code, modify it, and develop new programs.
# 
# Jupyter notebooks run in a web browser, so you can run them without installing any new software.
# But they have to connect to a Jupyter server.
# 
# You can install and run a server yourself, but to get started it is easier to use a service like [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is operated by Google.
# 
# [On the starting page for the book](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython) you will find a link for each chapter.
# If you click on one of these links, it opens a notebook on Colab.

# In[1]:
# If you are reading this notebook on Colab, you should see an orange logo in the upper left that looks like the letters `CO`.
# 
# If you are not running this notebook on Colab, [you can click here to open it on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/jupyter_intro.ipynb).

# ## What is a notebook?
# 
# A Jupyter notebook is made up of cells, where each cell contains either text or code.
# This cell contains text. 
# 
# The following cell contains code.

# In[3]:
print('Hello')

# In[4]:
# Click on the previous cell to select it.
# You should see a button on the left with a triangle inside a circle, which is the icon for "Play".
# If you press this button, Jupyter runs the code in the cell and displays the result.
# 
# When you run code in a notebook for the first time, it might take a few seconds to start.
# And if it's a notebook you didn't write, you might get a warning message.
# If you are running a notebook from a source you trust, which I hope includes me, you can press "Run Anyway".

# In[5]:
# Instead of clicking the "Play" button, you can also run the code in a cell by holding down `Shift` and pressing `Enter`.
# 
# If you are running this notebook on Colab, you should see buttons in the top left that say "+ Code" and "+ Text".  The first one adds a code cell and the second adds a text cell.
# If you want to try them out, select this cell by clicking on it, then press the "+ Text" button.
# A new cell should appear below this one.

# In[6]:
# Add some text to the cell.
# You can use the buttons to format it, or you can mark up the text using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
# When you are done, hold down `Shift` and press `Enter`, which will format the text you just typed and then move to the next cell.

# In[7]:
# At any time Jupyter is in one of two modes:
# 
# * In **command mode**, you can perform operations that affect cells, like adding and removing entire cells.
# 
# * In **edit mode**, you can edit the contents of a cell.
# 
# With text cells, it is obvious which mode you are in.
# In edit mode, the cell is split vertically, with the text you are editing on the left and the formatted text on the right.
# And you'll see text editing tools across the top.
# In command mode, you see only the formatted text.
# 
# With code cells, the difference is more subtle, but if there's a cursor in the cell, you are in edit mode.
# 
# To go from edit mode to command mode, press `ESC`.
# To go from command mode to edit mode, press `Enter`.

# In[8]:
# When you are done working on a notebook, you can close the window, but any changes you made will disappear.
# If you make any changes you want to keep, open the File menu in the upper left.
# You'll see several ways you can save the notebook.
# 
# * If you have a Google account, you can save the notebook in your Drive.
# 
# * If you have a GitHub account, you can save it on GitHub.
# 
# * Or if you want to save the notebook on your computer, select "Download" and then "Download .ipynb" The suffix ".ipynb" indicates that it is a notebook file, as opposed to ".py", which indicates a file that contains Python code only.

# In[9]:
# ## Code for *Think Python*
# 
# At the beginning of each notebook, you'll see a cell with code like this:

# In[10]:
from os.path import basename, exists

def download(url):
    filename = basename(url)
    if not exists(filename):
        from urllib.request import urlretrieve

        local, _ = urlretrieve(url, filename)
        print("Downloaded " + str(local))
    return filename

download('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/v3/thinkpython.py')

import thinkpython

# In[11]:
# You don't need to know how this code works, but when you get to the end of the book, most of it will make sense.
# As you might guess, it downloads a file -- specifically, it downloads `thinkpython.py`, which contains Python code provided specifically for this book.
# The last line "imports" this code, which means we can use the code in the notebook.
# 
# In other chapters, you will see code that downloads `diagram.py`, which is used to generated the diagrams in the book, and `jupyturtle.py`, which is used in several chapters to create turtle graphics.
# 
# In some places you will see a cell like this that begins with `%%expect`.

# In[12]:
%%expect SyntaxError

abs 42

# In[13]:
# `%%expect` is not part of Python -- it is a Jupyter "magic command" that indicates that we expect the cell to product an error.
# When you see this command, it means that the error is deliberate, usually intended to warn you about a common pitfall.
